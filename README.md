Description
This Augmented Reality based application will enable hotels to significantly change how they present their menu and engage with their visitors. AR technology is used to give hotels the ability to show their menus in 3D. Using this program, hotels may present their menu to consumers in 3D, enabling them to make informed decisions and ensure that their expectations are met, if not exceeded. The restaurant can improve its entire customer service approach by improving its capacity to satisfy customer prospects.
